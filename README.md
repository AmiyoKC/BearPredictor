# BearPredictor
This Jupyter notebook allows you to upload a picture of a bear and it'll classify the the image as grizzly bear, a black bear or a teddy bear.
The model can only predict one of these three classes and will not accurately predict other images.
The cnn resnet18 model was trained on images from Bing image search.
